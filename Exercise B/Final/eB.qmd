# Intro

This documents my attempts to generate a BibTeX bibliography on PDF remediation using an LLM.

## Instructions

You need to generate a BibTeX bibliography in a file called `eB.bib` in the same directory as this document. An example entry in that file is @Paliwal2024, which should resolve to a reference in this document.

Most of the papers are likely to be found in the ACM Digital Library. That online resource has a convention where each entry includes a large gray quote mark that leads to the BibTeX entry for the paper. You can copy and paste a few BibTeX entries if you find you need formatting examples.

You must upload your .qmd file, your .bib file, and your rendered .html file to Canvas. All must have the basename `eB`. Points will be deducted for any other name.

You should remove this instruction section from the final document.

# First attempt

## Initial prompt

Generate a bibliography with papers regarding PDF remediation.PDF remediation is the process of making PDFs accessible to screen readers that people with low vision may use.

Note: I am using ChatGPT o3-mini with the "Search" functionality. Using ChatGPT o3-mini enables advanced reasoning skills, which could help it deduce which papers are real and which are not. Additionally, the "Search" functionality gives it the ability to look for papers on the internet, which could be useful in retrieving more recent papers that were not included in the model's training corpus.

## Initial result

```
Below is a sample bibliography of academic papers and preprints that address various aspects of PDF remediation (in the context of both accessibility and security/data‐sanitization):

1. Wang, L. L., Cachola, I., Bragg, J., Cheng, E. Y.-Y., Haupt, C., Latzke, M., Kuehl, B., van Zuylen, M., Wagner, L., & Weld, D. S. (2021). *Improving the Accessibility of Scientific Documents: Current State, User Needs, and a System Solution to Enhance Scientific PDF Accessibility for Blind and Low Vision Users*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.00076. citeturn0search6  

2. Livathinos, N., Berrospi, C., Lysak, M., Kuropiatnyk, V., Nassar, A., Carvalho, A., Dolfi, M., Auer, C., Dinkla, K., & Staar, P. (2021). *Robust PDF Document Conversion Using Recurrent Neural Networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.09395. citeturn0academia11 

3. Bland, M., Iyer, A., & Levchenko, K. (2022). *Story Beyond the Eye: Glyph Positions Break PDF Text Redaction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.02285. citeturn0academia12  

4. Adhatarao, S., & Lauradoux, C. (2021). *Exploitation and Sanitization of Hidden Data in PDF Files*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.02707. citeturn0academia13  

These works explore topics ranging from automated conversion and structural recovery (to aid remediation for accessibility) to the challenges of hidden data and secure redaction in PDF documents. They should provide a solid starting point for research into methods and tools for remediating PDFs.
```

ChatGPT o3-mini generated the response above. I noticed that the first PDF is directly related to PDF remediation; however, the latter papers are less relevant. To improve this, I specify what PDF remediation is in the prompt.

# Second attempt

## Prompt

The first citation is relevant to PDF remediation, however, the others are not.

Generate a bibliography with papers regarding PDF remediation. PDF remediation is the process of making PDFs accessible to screen readers that people with low vision may use.

## Result

```
Below is a short bibliography of peer‐reviewed papers and preprints that focus on the remediation of PDFs—that is, modifying PDF documents so that they are accessible (e.g. properly tagged, with a logical reading order and descriptive alt‐text) for blind and low‐vision users using screen readers:

1. **Wang, L. L., Cachola, I., Bragg, J., Cheng, E. Y.-Y., Haupt, C., Latzke, M., Kuehl, B., van Zuylen, M., Wagner, L., & Weld, D. S. (2021).**  
   *Improving the Accessibility of Scientific Documents: Current State, User Needs, and a System Solution to Enhance Scientific PDF Accessibility for Blind and Low Vision Users.*  
   *arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.00076.*  
   citeturn1academia10  
   This paper provides a broad analysis of the challenges in making scientific PDFs accessible and introduces the SciA11y system—which employs machine learning to automatically convert PDFs into accessible HTML—to address issues such as improper tagging and reading order.

2. **Rajkumar, A. J., Lazar, J., Jordan, J. B., Darvishy, A., & Hutter, H. (2020).**  
   *PDF Accessibility of Research Papers: What Tools are Needed for Assessment and Remediation?*  
   In *Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS).*  
   This work discusses the current tools available for assessing PDF accessibility and outlines the technical challenges inherent in remediating PDFs to meet accessibility standards such as PDF/UA and WCAG, with a focus on practical remediation requirements.

3. **Schmitt‐Koopmann, F., Huang, E., & Darvishy, A. (2022).**  
   *Accessible PDFs: Applying Artificial Intelligence for Automated Remediation of STEM PDFs.*  
   In *Proceedings of the 24th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS '22).*  
   [https://doi.org/10.1145/3517428.3550407](https://doi.org/10.1145/3517428.3550407)  
   This paper describes an AI‐based approach that automatically remediates STEM PDF documents by correcting tagging issues and improving the logical reading order, thereby significantly reducing the manual effort required to produce accessible PDFs.

4. **Brinn, S., Cameron, C., Fielding, D., et al. (2022).**  
   *A Framework for Improving the Accessibility of Research Papers on arXiv.org.*  
   [Conference paper].  
   Although focused on papers hosted on arXiv, this work outlines a framework that includes remediation strategies (e.g. tagging, proper structuring, and reading order correction) to improve the accessibility of scholarly PDFs.  
   *(Note: Full bibliographic details and DOI should be verified from the conference proceedings.)*

Together, these publications address both the assessment of current accessibility shortcomings in scholarly PDFs and propose automated as well as semi-automated remediation solutions to help transform legacy and newly created PDFs into accessible documents suitable for use with assistive technologies.
```

The results from ChatGPT were more promising, where it returned 4 papers that were real and relevant to PDF remediation. However, they were not in BibTeX format, so I asked it to give them to be in BibTeX format.

# Third attempt

## Prompt

Can you give me the bibliography in BibTeX format?

## Result

```
Below are BibTeX entries for a selected bibliography on PDF remediation (the process of making PDFs accessible to screen readers for blind and low‐vision users):

These entries include a preprint on scientific PDF accessibility, a conference paper addressing tool requirements for PDF remediation, an AI-based automated remediation approach for STEM PDFs, and a framework for improving accessibility on arXiv. You can adjust the fields (such as conference name or publisher details) as needed for your use.
```

The results above are better, as the generated citations point to actual papers regarding PDF remediation (which I was able to confirm with a quick Google search) in the BibTeX format. Now, I will ask it to generate 10 more. Note, I am not asking it to generate too many at a time because I suspect ChatGPT may get "overwhelmed" if given too much work and start hallucinating.

# Fourth attempt

## Prompt

This is great, can you generate 10 more citations regarding PDF remediation. Remember, PDF remediation is the process of making PDFs accessible to screen readers that people with low vision may use. Make sure you are citing real papers.

Each entry addresses aspects of PDF remediation—from tool development for automated accessibility enhancements and evaluation of publisher practices to studies assessing the state of PDF accessibility in scholarly publishing. You can adjust the fields (e.g., pages or DOI) as needed for your citation style or specific requirements.
```

All of the entries in the generated bibliography point to real papers! Additionally, most papers are from reputable sources such as ACM (ex: @Mack2021), ResearchGate (ex: @Nganji2018), and CMU (ex: @Bigham2016).

I did notice that the citations don't have the "abstract" field and not all have the "url" field. However, since ChatGPT is doing a decent job of generating a bibliography with real papers about PDF remediation, I will continue asking it to generate more citations. Later, I will ask if ChatGPT is able to add an "abstract" and "url" field.

# Fifth attempt

## Prompt

Great, can you generate 5 more? I'd prefer for them to be papers from ACM, Arxiv, ResearchGate, or other credible sources.

## Result

Adjust any fields as needed to match your citation style or further publication details.
```

All of the entries generated by ChatGPT were correct and unique, except 1. ChatGPT generated @SchmittKoopmann2022 which it had already generated from attemps 2 and 3. I hypothesize that the reason why this citation got repeated is recency bias. Since ChatGPT first mentioned @SchmittKoopmann2022 in attempt 2, I suspect that it focused on trying not to repeat the more generations, and failed to not repeat an older generation.

It is also interest to note that the url for @Lo2023 is incorrect, indicating hallucination. However, for most of the papers, the urls were correct. This shows that ChatGPT o3-mini is (mostly) accurately retrieve correct information from the internet due to its "Search" feature. 

Nonetheless, ChatGPT provided a few more credible article in the PDF Remediation domain. I will attempt to generate additional sources one more time.

ChatGPT returned the same 5 papers that it had already given me before. In the next prompt, I explicitly tell ChatGPT to cite papers that are different from the ones it has already given me. This will help ensure that the generation results in new bibliography entries.

# Seventh attempt

## Prompt

Can you generate 5 more citations of research papers regarding PDF remediation. Remember, PDF remediation is the process of making PDFs accessible to screen readers that people with low vision may use. Make sure you are citing real papers and they are different from the ones you have already given me.

### Overview
- **Chintalapati et al. (2022)** present a dataset of alt texts from HCI publications to inform better alt text generation—a key component in PDF remediation.
- **Ribera et al. (2019)** analyze accessible proceedings through a case study of DSAI 2016, highlighting challenges and strategies in remediating scholarly PDFs.
- **Shen et al. (2022)** propose VILA, which improves the extraction of structured content from scientific PDFs—a crucial step toward automating remediation.
- **Singh et al. (2024)** introduce FigurA11y, an AI-driven tool that assists authors in generating high-quality alt text, improving the accessibility of PDF figures.
- **Williams et al. (2022)** focus on supporting quality alt text in computing publications, which is essential for creating accessible PDF documents.

These five entries expand the literature on PDF remediation by addressing different aspects—from alt text enhancement to structured content extraction and case studies on accessible scholarly proceedings. Adjust any fields (such as page numbers) as necessary to suit your citation style.
```

These results are great. All of the entries in the bibliography correspond to real papers about PDF remediation, either directly or indirectly. It is interesting to note that @Shen2022 isn't directly about PDF remediation. The paper discusses how to extract structured content from PDFs, and how this can improve PDF accessibility. Thus, this paper indirectly relates to PDF remediation. It is facinating how ChatGPT o3-mini was able to draw the connection of how extracting structured content from PDFs can be used to improve PDF accessbility. I suspect that it is able to do so due to the reasoning abilities that ChatGPT o3-mini has. It reasons "out loud", as it displays what it is "thinking". As a result, this chain of thought process led to relevant results.

It is also interesting to note that the urls of @Ribera2019 and @Shen2022 are incorrect. This is probably because either ChatGPT was unable to find the correct urls during its search or it hallucinated. However, for most of the papers, the urls are correct!

Now that I have a decent bibliography, I want to test ChatGPT's ability to fill in missing information. To conduct this test, I will pass 5 entries from the bibliography back to ChatGPT, and ask it to fill in missing information. I will start by asking it to fill in the "url" field.

# Eighth attempt

## Prompt

I will give you a bibliography with 5 entries. These entries do not have a "url" field. Can you determine the url for the respective paper, and add the "url" field? If you are not 100% sure what the url is for the paper, then do not add a "url" field.

```
For the first three entries, the URL fields were derived directly from their DOIs. Since the last two entries do not have a DOI (or we are not 100% sure of their permanent URL), no URL fields were added for them.
```
Of 5 entries I provided, ChatGPT was able to add the "url" field for 3 of them. I manually verified that the urls are correct. This test goes to show the capabilities of ChatGPT to explore the internet, retrieve the urls, analyze them for certainty, and add them if the model is certain. For 2 entries, ChatGPT was uncertain that the urls were correct, and thus, did not add them as instructions stated.

In fact, when ChatGPT is reasoning, it displays what it is "thinking". Here is a snippit of the reasoning process: "I'm thinking through avoiding URLs for Brady2015 and Bigham2016 if their details aren't certain. Safe to go with DOIs from Mack2021, Nganji2018, and Ribera2008." This goes to show that it is able to analyze its findings and determine how confident it is in their accuracy.

Finally, I'd like to test if ChatGPT 3o-mini is able to add the "abstract" field. I will ask the model to search for the abstract, and add the field only if it is certain in its accuracy. I will keep the 5 entries I give as reference the same to keep the experiment fair.

```
For the first two entries, the abstracts were obtained from reliable sources (e.g., the ACM Digital Library and publisher websites). Since we could not verify the exact abstract texts for the remaining three entries with complete certainty, no “abstract” field has been added for them.
```

ChatGPT was able to fill in the abstracts for the first 2 sources. In fact, it explains that it was able to do so because the abstracts were retrieved from credible sources. However, upon closer inspection, it is evident that the abstract that ChatGPT added for @Mack2021 is actually incorrect, and the abstract that ChatGPT added for @Nganji2018 is mostly correct but incomplete. This suggests that the model was either unable t determine what an "abstract" is when it was searching the internet for those respective papers, or that it hallucinated in generating those abstracts. This experiment demonstrates ChatGPT's limitation in its ability to parse and identify online information (specifically abstracts in this case) the way humans can.


# Final Attempt

As of now, I have asked ChatGPT to generate a bibliography using its ability to search the internet. However, now I want to test its ability to provide a bibliography given some information about a few papers. This will test ChatGPT's formatting abilities compared to its searching and reasoning abilities.

## Prompt

Here is some information on 3 papers:


I want you to generate a bibliography using those papers. Use the following bibliography entry as an example of how to format your bibliography:
```{bibtex}
@article{Paliwal2024,

doi = {10.1145/3702317},
abstract = {PDF documents are usually not born-accessible, and so document authors need to put in additional work (remediation) to make them accessible for people with disabilities. Unfortunately, this step is often overlooked and hard to execute, resulting in a large number of inaccessible PDF documents on the internet. Previously, there have been research efforts to investigate potential solutions for remediating PDF documents for accessibility. However, most of the existing research focuses on accessibility of long or scientific PDF documents meant for passive reading. PDF documents come in different types, and this research project focuses on a distinct type of PDF document—forms—where the user is required to interact with the PDF document and enter data. Through our research work we identified that the PDF form remediation process is non-intuitive, repetitive, and overwhelming due to the high-information density of PDF forms, and existing research and tools do not yet address the challenges. Our research work culminated in the creation of a tool – FormA11y – that addresses these challenges by making the repetitive and painstaking process of form remediation easier. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of FormA11y against the industry standard tool – Adobe Acrobat – for PDF form remediation, we performed a within-subject user study with 20 participants. With FormA11y, users remediated forms 2.8 times faster while creating more accurately accessible PDF forms.},

## Result

Here you refer to the `eB.bib` file.

(Just kidding about fifteenth---I don't know how many attempts it will take to get a satisfactory result)

# Conclusion

Here is where you describe what you did and any thoughts about how it came out.

- Mostly good
- Search feature is useful in retrieving information
- Limitations for more complex requests like asking for abstracts
- After prompt 2, it reasons to get papers that are relevant.
  - "Focusing on remediation"
  - "Assessing relevant"
  - "Refining selection"
  - ![](prompt_2_reasoning.png)
- 6th attempt - returned papers I already had. So had to explicitly say to generate new ones in attempt 7.
- Example reasoning from 7th prompt
  - ![](prompt_7_reasoning.png)
- Reasoning for urls

# Addendum: Features of this file

Note: delete this section before you turn in the file!

-   Front matter
    -   Includes your name
    -   Includes the keyword "today" which resolves to the date on which you render the document
    -   Includes fonts---you should install these fonts on your computer or change the font specification to fonts you already have on your computer
    -   Includes the format (html) to which Quarto will render
    -   Includes some directives that are specific to that format: toc and embed-resources
    -   `toc` causes the table of contents to be rendered, on the right side of the frame by default
    -   `embed-resources` causes any diagrams to be included in the html file itself rather than linked---that way you can just submit the html file and I can view it instead of having to submit linked files
-   Headings: top level headings are preceded by a \# and a space; second level headings are preceded by \## and a space; you can go down several levels by increasing the number of \# symbols
-   Bulleted lists, formed by preceding the list with a blank line (or a heading) and beginning each line with a dash and a space (both are important)
-   LaTeX symbols, in this case $\langle$ and $\rangle$, which resolve to angle brackets when you render the document ... you can include any LaTeX math expressions between dollar signs or double dollar signs ... by the way, any dollar signs meant as real dollar signs should be preceded by a backslash, like \$ this, so Quarto doesn't get confused about whether you are starting an equation
-   Programmatic keywords, preceded and followed by a backtick, in this case, the name `eB.bib` bibliography file ... this causes the keyword to be rendered in a code font
-   Emphasis, by surrounding an *important* word with asterisks, causing it to be rendered in italics

Of course, you will delete all the instructions and comments in this file before you turn it in! I don't need to read them when I read your solution. The files you turn in (the qmd and the rendered html) will just include your work. These instructions and comments are just to help you get going.
